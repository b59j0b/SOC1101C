Additional Course Description and   Learning Outcomes
Welcome to Sociology 1101!    This is a general survey course of Sociology as a discipline,   but   I   like to   think   of   it   as   a   course   on   critical   thinking   about   social   life. Sociological   investigations   range   from   the   analysis   of   small   groups   to   large   social   systems. Sociology   explores   how   we   as   individuals   and societies are shaped by our collective social experience.
While it is useful to learn facts about society and human   interaction   (i.e., what   happened,   when,   and   who   was   involved), it   is   perhaps   more   important   to   consider   these   facts   critically, to   be   careful   in   drawing conclusions, and to be aware of their complexity. What are the sources of our facts? Are the      facts complete? Are the sources unbiased? The conclusions we reach regarding social situations are   often   the   basis   for   actions   that   have   far-reaching   effects   on   ourselves   and   on   others.
Sociology   is   the   scientific   study   of   humans   in   groups. It   provides   a   systematic,   critical   approach   to considering   facts   and   their   implications   for   social   action. In   this   course, our   main   goals   will   be   to   (1)   challenge   our   own   views   of   social   life, and   (2) acquire   some   intellectual   tools   and   analytic   skills   to   help us   attempt   to   reach   a   better   understanding   of   the   effects   of   society   on   individuals   and   individuals   on   society.
Teaching Methods
We are all unique individuals who learn differently, and we have designed   this course with neurodiversity and   divergent   thinking in mind. To facilitate this, we will employ a flexible environment that fosters a   culture of scholarship which allows us to explore some   topics in greater detail and promotes student-centered learning through a flipped classroom environment, in-class workshops, guest speakers, demonstrations, and   traditional   lectures.
If you have concerns, comments or   suggestions please feel free to bring them up in class as Iam sure other   students or myself are thinking about   the same issues. Please check your email and virtual campus on a regular basis for Brightspace announcements.

Exams   will be done on Brightspace and   will   use   the   following proctoring   tools:   Respondus Lockdown   Browser   and   the   use   of   real-time proctoring   with Zoom   (Zoom Live Proctoring) maybe used. These   tools   block   access   to   applications   and   internet   browsing during   the exam. It is important   to   note   that   there   is   no   recording of   students   during   the   exam   and   there   will   be   no   use of   the Respondus Monitor.   You must agree   to   the   terms and   conditions   for installing   the   Lockdown   Browser.   Your   camera must always be on during   the exam   if   Zoom Live   Proctoring   is   in   use.
Assessment   Policies and   Expectations
Course   notes are the   responsibility of each student,   and   you   will   be   responsible   for   all   assigned   readings   and material   presented during the term,   including this outline. Class   attendance   is   strongly   recommended   at   the University of Ottawa.   Students are also expected   to   read   the   material;   take   notes;   ask   questions;   and   engage   in class discussions of the topics and themes that form   the   basis   of this   course.   This   means   taking   part   in   a   professional and   informed debate or discussion   with   one’s   classmates.   Occasionally,   and without   warning,   I   will   call   upon students to discuss a   point   or contribute   to   a   discussion,   so   please   be   prepared.
All students are   required to   have a   university e-mailand   internet   account.   Please   contact the   University   Computing   Center   if you do   not   have one.   Please ensure whatever   e-mail   address   you   choose   to   use   is   one   that   will work with your   university account   (if   not this account, then   your   university   account   should   be   forwarded   to   your   main account).
The dates for evaluations are   indicated.   If you are   unable   to   turn   in   any   of the   assignments   on   the   dates   as   scheduled,   it   is strongly   recommended that you consider taking the   course   at   a   more   convenient   time.
Note: Students should expect a two-week turnaround for   marked   evaluations   SUPPLEMENTAL AND GRADE-RAISING   EXAMINATIONS ARE   NOT AVAILABLE
